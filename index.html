    <p>I've found myself a bit dissillusioned with the fact that the internet every day looks a bit more 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead</a> than the next. 
    While as someone who has grown up with these algorithmic 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber">skinner boxes</a>
    I find my useage of the internet has drifted far away from what it used to represent. 
    We're not eradicating these creations in one day, so rather we ought to start balancing it out. <br/><br/>
    To paraphrase the internet's busiest music nerd. 
    Let's leave the recommendation algorithm aside to try bringing a bit of human curation into how we listen.
    I'll start with articles, essays, youtube, etc. but I don't want to pigeon hole it too deeply. 
    <br/><br/>
    I promise to keep AI generated slop as far away from this list as possible.
    Especially people trying to pass off AI crap as human made (not that they are any good at it anyway).
